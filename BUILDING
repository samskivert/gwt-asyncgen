Building GWT AsyncGen
---------------------

If you want to build this library yourself, just do the following:

Place two jar files into the lib/ subdirectory:
- ant.jar
- gwt-user.jar

These should be of reasonably modern vintage (Ant 1.7+ and GWT 1.7+).

Then simply run:

% ant dist

and the gwt-asyncgen.jar file will magically appear in the dist/ directory.
